## Yelp Event Assistant

This will demonstate the use of service workers with Rails.  To keep it simple the offline experience will be to display the nearest, upcoming 3 events that are being attended.

Try out [Yelp Event Assistant](https://powerful-sierra-88528.herokuapp.com/).  Note: Yelp Events is in beta so some zip codes will have no events; use zip codes for major cities for best results.  Chrome Dev Tools has a way to simulate offline.  Click on the Application tab, and then Service Workers, and then check Offline.  This will simulate no network for that tab.
